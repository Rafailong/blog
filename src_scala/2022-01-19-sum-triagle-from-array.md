another week, another code challenge

## description

given an array of integers, print a sum triangle from it such that
the first level has all array elements.
from then, at each level number of elements is one less than the previous level 
and elements at the level is be the **sum** of consecutive two elements in the previous level. 

### example

```scala
def sumTriangle(number: List[Int]): List[List[Int]] = ???

val input = List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

show(
  sumTriangle(input)
)
// stdout output
// List(
//   List(48),
//   List(20, 28), 
//   List(8, 12, 16), 
//   List(3, 5, 7, 9), 
//   List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
// )
```

## solution

```scala mdoc:invisible
import scala.annotation.tailrec
```

first, we need to find a way to sum the elements of a list in pairs, 
something that does like:

```haskell
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] -> [1 + 2, 2 + 3, 3 + 4, 4 + 5] = [3, 5, 7, 9]
```

ðŸ¤” intresting enough, this looks like we need to `zip` one element with its successor.

```scala mdoc
def sum(ns: List[Int]): List[Int] =
  ns.zip(ns.tail).map { case (a, b) => a + b }

sum(List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5))
```

nice! this seems to work correctly. Now that we can produce a level of
our trigle from a base level next step is to produce the whole triangle
from our input level (base level).

but first, let's get a bit piky and define a type alias for our triangle

```scala mdoc
type Triangle = List[List[Int]]

object Triangle {
  def apply(ns: List[Int]): Triangle = ns :: Nil
}
```

now we can implement our *main* function:

```scala mdoc
def sumTriangle(numbers: List[Int]): Triangle = {

  @tailrec
  def go(ns: List[Int], triangle: Triangle): Triangle =
    ns match {
      case _ :: _ =>
        val level = sum(ns)
        go(level, level :: triangle)
      case Nil => triangle
    }

  go(numbers, Triangle(numbers))
}
```

as you may notice, this implementation is tail recursive (proved by the compiler)
and it build a triangle from the base to the pick. let's give it a try!

```scala mdoc
val triangle = sumTriangle(
  List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
)
```

as an extra let's try to pretty print our triangle

```scala mdoc
def show(triangle: Triangle): String =
  triangle.foldRight("") { case (ns, str) =>
    s"${ns.mkString(",")}" ++ System.lineSeparator() ++ str
  }

show(triangle)
```
