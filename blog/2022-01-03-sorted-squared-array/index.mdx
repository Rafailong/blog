import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';
import FirstAttempt from '!!raw-loader!./solutions/first-attempt.kts';
import SecondAttempt from '!!raw-loader!./solutions/second-attempt.kts';
import BonusAttempt from '!!raw-loader!./solutions/bonus-attempt.kts';

this time we will try to (satisfactory) solve a coding challenge.

### description

write a function that takes in a non-empty array of integers that are sorted
in ascending order and returns a new array of the same length with the squares
of the original integers also sorted in ascending order.

### first attempt

first attempt which fails when `array` includes negative numbers
give `array = [-2, -1]` output is `[4, 1]` which is wrong
because correct output should be sorted in ascending order:

<CodeBlock className="language-kotlin" title="first-attempt.kts">{FirstAttempt}</CodeBlock>

what i like from `first-attempt` (failed) solution is that
**we have no state** (we are not mutating anything), we are only
traversing our input array.

### second attempt

an _optimal_ solution would be to use a data structure that preserves
the order of its elements i.e binary tree
but, given thath we have no binary tree at our disposal we can leverage
Kotlin native [BinarySearch](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/list-operations.html#binary-search-in-sorted-lists)
methods in `List`. we need to be careful with the return value of 
such a function in order to prevent index bound exceptions:

<CodeBlock className="language-kotlin" title="second-attempt.kts">{SecondAttempt}</CodeBlock>

what i **dislike** from `second-attempt` solution is that: we have state mutations.
on the other hand i like that we are still traversing our input array once 
meaning `O(n)` complexity which I think is nice!

### bonus

as a bonus here is a 3rd optional solution that is not as efficient as the previous one
but this third solution is based on immutable data structures which is always good:

<CodeBlock className="language-kotlin" title="bonus-attempt.kts">{BonusAttempt}</CodeBlock>
